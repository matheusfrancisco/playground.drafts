## Just a bunch of draft code and ideas
# My Roadmap to self improvement (WIP)

This is my roadmap to self improvement.
Some topics that I want to learning this year 2021.

### Topics

* Programming: Clojure (learning about whole clj world), Rust, Haskell, Elixir
* Protocols: gRPC, RPC
* Infra: +Kubernets, +Git
* Web: WebAssembly
* Agiles: TDD, DDD
* Improve some topics:  Software Architecture (skills), Patterns, DDD, Microservices, Test(Unit, Integration, Contract, E2E)
* Computer Science: Data Structures, Algorithm Complexity, Dynamic Programming, NP-complete problems

Starting learning about: Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Genetic Algorithms


## What book I'm learning.

* [ ] 14 Habits of Highly Productive Developers by Zeno Rocha. (almost finish)
* [ ] Domain drive design (started but not finished yet)
* [ ] Design Patterns (started but not finished yet)
* [ ] Clean Architecture (started but not finished yet)
* [ ] Cracking coding interview (solve some problems)
* I'll put non tech books here

## What I read this year
* [x] Refactoring
* [x] Test Drive Developemnt - Kent Beck
* [x] Joy of Clojure
* [x] Clojure for the Brave and true
* [x] Clean Code
* I'll put non tech books here
