Problem Statement#
Implement a function, find_product(lst), which modifies a list so that each 
index has a product of all the numbers present in the list except the number 
stored at that index.

Input:#
A list of numbers (could be floating points or integers)

Output:#
A list such that each index has a product of all the numbers in the list except 
the number stored at that index.

Sample Input#
arr = [1,2,3,4]
Sample Output#
arr = [24,12,8,6]
