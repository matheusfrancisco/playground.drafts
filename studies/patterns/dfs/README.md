## DFS ( Depth First Search) technique to traverse a tree

We will be using recursion (or we can also use a stack for te iterative approach) to keep
track of all the previous (parent) nodes while traversing. This also means that the space
complexity of the algorithm will be O(H) where H is the maximum height of the tree.
